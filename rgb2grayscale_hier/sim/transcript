#                 [[-time start stop] ...]
# 
#   -help           Display this usage message.
#   -input vcd_file Specify vcd_file as the input VCD file. When the input
#                   file has extension .gz or .Z, gunzip or uncompress is
#                   invoked. When the extension is .vpd or .fsdb, vpd2vcd or
#                   fsdb2vcd is invoked.
#   -pipe command   The -pipe command option specifies a shell command which
#                   is used to generate the VCD file file_name. This option
#                   will invoke the command and directly pipe the output
#                   VCD file to vcd2saif.
#   -output bsaif   Specify bsaif as the output backward SAIF file. When the
#                   file has extension .gz, the output file will be in gzip
#                   format.
#   -32|-64          Specify to use either 32 bit or 64 bit executable.
#   -instance path  In general path is the absolute path of the design instance
#                   as instantiated in your testbench.
#                   For gate or RTL VCD files, all signals of the instance
#                   are included in the backward SAIF file. When no instances
#                   and no forward SAIF files are specified, all signals in
#                   the VCD file are included.
#   -format lang    Specify lang as the HDL language used for the
#                   testbench and simulated designs.
#                   lang can be "Verilog" or "VHDL", if omitted
#                   the default is assumed to be "Verilog".
#   -top path       Specify path as the top level path in the forward SAIF
#                   file; if omitted, the default is assumed to be "top".
#   -no_div         When parsing the instance paths (in the -top, -instance,
#                   etc., arguments) assume that the hierarchical divider
#                   is a white space. When calling vcd2saif from your command
#                   shell with the -no_div option, path name arguments need
#                   to be enclosed in double quotes.
#   -time           Specify the time window for SAIF generation. Multiple
#                   time windows can be specified
# 
# The following arguments are applicable only to VCD files generated
# using mixed-language simulation:
#   -testbench lang Specify lang as the HDL language used for the
#                   testbench. lang can be "Verilog" or "VHDL", if omitted
#                   the default is assumed to be "Verilog".
#   -verilog_instance path    Specify that the given instance path is a
#                   Verilog language design.
#   -vhdl_instance path       Specify that the given instance path is a
#                   VHDL language design.
